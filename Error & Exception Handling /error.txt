## Error  

Errors are problems in a program that prevent it from executing normally. They can be broadly categorized into two types:

Types of Errors:

1- Syntax Errors
  - Occur when Python parser cannot understand your code
  - Also known as parsing errors
  - Detected during program parsing (before execution)
  - Must be fixed before the program can run

Example:

print("Hello world"  # Missing closing parenthesis
if x > 5  # Missing colon
x = [1, 2, 3  # Missing closing bracket


-----------------------------------

## Exception

- Occur during program execution (at runtime)
- Code syntax is correct but operation is not possible
- Can be handled to prevent program crashes

Example:

print(10 / 0)  # ZeroDivisionError
print(int("abc"))  # ValueError
print(undefined_variable)  # NameError

----------------------------------

## Common Built-in Exceptions:


Exception                	Description	                        Example

ZeroDivisionError      	Division by zero	                     10 / 0
ValueError	            Invalid value	                        int("abc")
TypeError             	Invalid operation	                     "5" + 3
IndexError	            Index out of range	                  [1,2,3][5]
KeyError	             Dictionary key not found	              {"a":1}["b"]
FileNotFoundError	     File doesn't exist	                 open("nonexistent.txt")
NameError            	Variable not defined	               print(undefined_var)
ImportError	         Module cannot be imported          	import nonexistent_module
