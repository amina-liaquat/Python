## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.Objects are instances of classes, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Python supports OOP and provides the following main concepts:

- Class
- Object
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

## Class and Object

- A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
- An object is an instance of a class.
