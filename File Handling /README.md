# File Handling

---
File handling in Python lets you create, read, write, and delete files. It allows programs to store data permanently on disk rather than just in memory.
Python provides a built-in function open() to work with files.

## Syntex of ```open()```

```open("filename", "mode")```

## Common Modes:

- "r" → Read (default) – error if file doesn’t exist.
- "w" → Write – creates new file or overwrites existing.
- "a" → Append – adds data at the end of the file.
- "x" → Create – creates new file, error if exists.
- "b" → Binary mode (e.g., images, PDFs).
- "t" → Text mode (default).
